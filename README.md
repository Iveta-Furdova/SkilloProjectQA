Welcome to my personal project for the QA Automation Engineer course at Skillo. This project represents a culmination of skills acquired throughout the course, focusing on practical application within the realm of automated testing.

The project encompasses a comprehensive Test Suite consisting of 5 Tests meticulously designed to interact with various features of the iSkillo platform. Leveraging industry-standard technologies such as TestNG and Selenium WebDriver, coupled with best practices in software testing, the project is organized using the efficient Page Object Modeling (POM) approach and PageFactory for enhanced maintainability and scalability.

The suite's test scenarios cover a wide array of functionalities essential for ensuring the robustness and reliability of the iSkillo platform:

    Successful Login: Verifying the ability of existing users to effortlessly log in and out of their accounts, ensuring a seamless user experience.

    Creating a New Post: This test scenario focuses on the creation of engaging content by allowing users to upload images and add captions, essential for fostering user engagement.

    Deleting an Existing Post: Ensuring users have the capability to manage their content effectively by validating the deletion functionality of already existing posts.

    Liking the First Post on the Home Page: Verifying the core functionality of user interaction by enabling users to express appreciation for content via the 'like' feature.

    Change Profile Photo: Verifying the functionality to change the profile photo, ensuring users can customize their profiles with ease and accuracy.


In addition to the robust test scenarios, the suite is equipped with advanced features such as automatic screenshot capture upon test failure, facilitating efficient debugging and issue resolution. Moreover, the inclusion of a testng.xml file streamlines test execution, allowing seamless integration with Maven for enhanced automation capabilities.

Furthermore, the suite is meticulously crafted to ensure compatibility with the Google Chrome browser, catering to a wide audience of users leveraging this popular browsing platform.

In summary, this project represents not only a demonstration of technical proficiency but also a commitment to quality assurance practices aimed at delivering a seamless and delightful user experience on the iSkillo platform.
